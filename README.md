# Community PC's   
### Final Coding Dojo Solo Project     

## Overview   
Communnity PC's is an application in which computer building enthusiasts can build and share their current PC builds or theoretical PC builds. **Users can view the posts without creating an account however creating a post requires registering with the site.** This application was built with the intention of practing the MERN stack and is very expandable in terms of future potential features. 

Please excuse UI as this app was one of my first jabs at using the MERN stack hence why some it may not be as streamlined as my later works, however there is full CRUD functionality and room for improvement!
